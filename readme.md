## Notes

1. Upload plugin via WordPress > Plugins > Add New > Upload
2. Updates do not appear automatically in your WordPress admin.
3. Changing prices will be ignored on products that do not currently have Name Your Price enabled
4. Changing Name Your Price mode will be ignored on product types that do not support Name Your Price (ex: Variable products, since Name Your Price is handled at the variation level)
